# Classical Differential Geometry using Maxima
This is an introduction to elementary Differential Geometry using Maxima. Code for the calculation of the 1st and 2nd fundamental form, for the shape operator, the GAUSS and mean curvature are presented in form of user-defined functions. The CHRISTOFFEL symbols, the RIEMANN tensors, the RICCI tensor and the curvature scalar R are also used via the Maxima package ctensor.
